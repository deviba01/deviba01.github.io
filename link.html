         <h1>Hi There! Welcome to Believing and Achieving Information Center </h1>
		<p><i>Believing and achieving is an organization that works with students in elementary schools. Every Tuesday and Thursday
		I go to Carrie Lee elementary school to spend time with at risk students. For the first half-hour we work on homework. After that
		it is social time. It is a wonderful experience. </i></p>
